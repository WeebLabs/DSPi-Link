/*
 * board_table.h - the pins the bridge may use on each supported chip.
 *
 * Implements bridge spec 4.4. One table per chip lists, for each job a pin
 * can do, every pin the bridge offers for it. Anything not listed is never
 * offered: flash and PSRAM pins, USB pins, the boot console UART, strapping
 * pins, input-only pins for outputs, and pins that some common modules do
 * not break out.
 *
 * The lists are explicit arrays rather than bitmasks so a reader can check
 * them against a datasheet line by line. They are sorted ascending, which is
 * also the order the settings page shows them in.
 *
 * This header and board_tables.c are portable (no ESP-IDF headers), so the
 * host tests check all four tables in one run. board.h picks the table for
 * the chip the firmware is running on.
