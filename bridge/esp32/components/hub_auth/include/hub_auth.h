/*
 * hub_auth.h - the bridge's optional PIN, its paired clients and its rate
 * limits.
 *
 * Implements Link spec 6.2 for a fixed PIN, as bridge spec 8.9 describes:
 *
 *   - The PIN is stored only as a salted PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hash.
 *   - Pairing with the PIN issues a token: AUTH_TOKEN_BYTES random bytes as
 *     base64url. Only the token's SHA-256 is kept, with the client's name,
 *     when it was created and when it was last seen.
 *   - Five failures from one address within a minute lock that address out
 *     for a minute; twenty from all addresses together lock out PIN guesses
 *     for everyone. A fixed PIN is never invalidated by failures.
 *   - Changing the PIN or turning it off forgets every client.
 *   - If the random source or a hash fails, nothing is set, issued or
 *     accepted: every function answers HUB_AUTH_UNAVAILABLE instead.
 *   - If the saved PIN could not be read, the PIN counts as on but nothing
 *     is accepted until a new PIN is set (hub_auth_mark_unreadable()).
 *
 * Portable: no ESP-IDF headers. Randomness, hashing, time and saving come
 * through hub_auth_io_t, so the host tests can drive it with fakes; the
 * hub task supplies PSA crypto and NVS. Every function here is called only
 * by the hub task, which owns the hub_auth_t, so nothing needs locking.
